Please note the following potential times when an issue might be in Terraform core:

* [Configuration language](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html) or resource ordering issues
* [State](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/index.html) and [state backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/index.html) issues
* [Provisioner](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/index.html) issues
* [Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) issues
* Spans resources across multiple providers

If you are running into one of these scenarios, we recommend opening an issue in the [Terraform core repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/) instead.

### Terraform and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provider versions

<!--- Please run `terraform -v` to show the Terraform core version and provider version(s).
If you are using a local copy of the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) provider for Terraform, run the plugin directly to get the version: `<path-to-plugin>/terraform-provider-oci`
If you are not running the latest version of Terraform or the provider, please upgrade because your issue may have already been fixed. [Terraform documentation on provider versioning](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#provider-versions). --->

### Affected Resource(s)

<!--- Please list the affected resources and data sources. For example, "oci_core_vcn". --->


### Terraform configuration files
